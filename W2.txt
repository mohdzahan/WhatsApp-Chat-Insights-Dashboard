[17/05/24, 9:20:20 AM] Bhuvanya Raghunathan: Dear all,
     Good morning. Hope you guys have received the mail from Examly portal. Based on the guidance from placement, kindly follow,


1. Taking up the course and test is mandatory. 


2. Complete all the video lectures since you have assessment in each module.. you need to complete the same.

3. Then take the final assessment. Your progress will be tracked.
[17/05/24, 10:40:26 AM] Shashank: Can we just do the assessments?
[17/05/24, 10:41:19 AM] Bhuvanya Raghunathan: No you have assessment in each module which also has to be taken
[17/05/24, 8:28:01 PM] Bhuvanya Raghunathan: Reminder
[17/05/24, 8:29:17 PM] Bhuvanya Raghunathan: The report will be submitted by 1st June and before that everyone must complete it. Your progress will be tracked every day
[18/05/24, 1:29:11 PM] Bhuvanya Raghunathan: Attempt for practice assessment increased to 5
[20/05/24, 11:49:49 AM] Bhuvanya Raghunathan: Guys, this is a gentle reminder to complete the course in examly portal. Referred the consolidated report and no one has completed in AIML. 

In continuation with this examly tasks, you have placement drives, if you don't complete this, you Will not be allowed to attend placement drive.
[20/05/24, 12:00:51 PM] Shashank: Ma'am I think we'll need more time for this...
We came to know only recently...

and a note worthy point is that the video content is not proportional to the questions. For 8 - 15 mins of content to 2 hour tests with 9 questions, its not reasonable to solve. Standard industry time for a DSA question is around 25 mins. (120 / 9 = 13 mins).

The questions are definitely good though, just that the prep material to solve it is not enough ‎<This message was edited>
[20/05/24, 12:03:01 PM] Ayushmaan vi: Yes ma'am, this is completely true.

The videos uploaded are just basic 5-10 minutes introduction on the topics, and are nowhere near the level of the questions.

Hence, completing this within such a short period of notice seems to be extremely difficult, and also, until and unless there's a crystal clear understanding of the topics, the PA questions can't be solved at all.
[20/05/24, 12:03:30 PM] Bhuvanya Raghunathan: I'll inform this to placement co ordinator
[20/05/24, 12:04:42 PM] Ayushmaan vi: Okay ma'am
[20/05/24, 12:17:04 PM] Bhuvanya Raghunathan: But you have already attended the training and we hope the in-depth concept of all the DSA topics are covered in the training session.
And also you have completed the DSA in your curriculum. 

So this examly portal is mainly launched to  equip with DSA skills for placement. Hence it is mandatory to take up the test.
[20/05/24, 12:17:26 PM] Bhuvanya Raghunathan: If you have any other queries kindly call
